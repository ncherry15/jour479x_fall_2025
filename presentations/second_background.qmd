## Question
Which men’s college basketball teams are meaningfully outperforming or underperforming their preseason expectations during the first month of the season, and what early-season traits predict these deviations?

The goal is to compare preseason projections to early-season performance and identify statistical patterns—especially on offense and defense—that explain why certain teams exceed or fall short of expectations.

Teams that outperform early will likely exhibit strong offensive efficiency, improved opponent shooting defense, and low turnover rates. Underperformers may struggle with shooting, defensive lapses, or roster continuity issues.

## Data Sources

To answer the question in a one-month timeframe, all data will come from free, accessible sources:

### **Preseason Projection Data**
- **BartTorvik (T-Rank) Preseason Projections**  
  Provides projected AdjOE, AdjDE, efficiency margin, returning minutes, and transfer impact.  

- **AP Top 25 & Coaches Poll**  
  Provides categorical expectations for teams entering the season.

### **Early-Season Performance Data**
- **T-Rank Game Performance Metrics**  
  Includes offensive and defensive efficiencies, schedule strength, and game-by-game performance ratings.

- **Sports Reference (CBB)**  
  Provides box scores, shooting percentages, turnovers, and roster data.

### **Contextual Data**
- Roster continuity (Torvik)
- Transfer additions (Torvik “PORPAGATU!” metric)
- Strength of schedule (Torvik, Sports Reference)
- Game location (home/away/neutral)

All data can be collected manually, scraped responsibly, or imported via CSV files.

## Data Collection Plan

1. **Download preseason projections**  
   From Torvik: projected AdjOE, AdjDE, EM, roster continuity, transfer impact.

2. **Collect first-month game results**  
   Retrieve actual offensive and defensive efficiencies, shooting %, and turnovers.

3. **Construct deviation metrics**
   - Efficiency margin difference = Actual EM − Projected EM  
   - Ranking change vs. preseason  
   - Wins above expectation based on Torvik’s Game Scores

4. **Identify overperformers and underperformers**
   Using deviation thresholds or quantiles.

5. **Analyze traits of each group**
   Variables that may predict deviation:
   - Effective FG%  
   - Opponent eFG%  
   - Turnover rate (TOR)  
   - Returning minutes  
   - Transfer productivity  
   - Strength of schedule  

6. **Visualize the results**
   Examples:
   - Scatterplot: Projected EM vs. Actual EM  
   - Bar chart: Ranking change from preseason to present  
   - Table: Top over/underperformers with key stats  
   - Efficiency radar charts for select teams

## Early Hypotheses

- **H1:** Teams with high roster continuity are more likely to outperform early-season expectations.  
- **H2:** Early-season overperformers will have lower opponent shooting percentages compared to projections.  
- **H3:** Underperforming teams will show elevated turnover rates or unexpectedly low shooting efficiency.

These hypotheses will guide the analysis and interpretation once data is collected.

## Planned Analysis & Visualizations

### **Descriptive Analysis**
- Summary of preseason projections  
- Early-season efficiency summaries  
- Ranking and performance deviations

### **Comparative Analysis**
- Compare overperformers vs. underperformers on:
  - Shooting splits  
  - Turnovers  
  - Defensive metrics  
  - Continuity metrics  

### **Visualizations**
- Efficiency margin deviation plot  
- Opponent eFG% change chart  
- Roster continuity vs. performance scatterplot  
- Team-level radar charts (optional)

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of the project, the analysis should reveal:
- Which teams started significantly better or worse than expected  
- Which early-season metrics are most predictive of over/underperformance  
- Whether roster continuity or transfer reliance plays a major role  
- A replicable framework for analyzing early-season performance

This project replicates the structure of early-season projection analyses used across other sports, including college football (SP+ over/underperformance) and NBA/NHL early-season analytics.

## Next Steps

- Begin pulling preseason projections from Torvik  
- Create a spreadsheet or R dataframe combining preseason and early-season data  
- Build visuals that highlight deviation and explanatory variables  
- Draft narrative findings and interpretations

## R Setup (Optional Starter Code)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(janitor)

# Example structure for reading preseason and early-season data
preseason <- read_csv("preseason_projections.csv") |> clean_names()
early_season <- read_csv("early_season_stats.csv") |> clean_names()

# Join datasets
merged <- preseason |> 
  left_join(early_season, by = "team")

# Example deviation calculation
merged <- merged |> 
  mutate(efficiency_deviation = actual_em - projected_em)
